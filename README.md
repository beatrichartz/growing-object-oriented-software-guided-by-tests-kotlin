# Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests in Kotlin

This is a follow-along Kotlin implementation of the Auction Sniper described in the book 
[Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests](http://growing-object-oriented-software.com).

Feel free to open a PR if this needs to be updated.

## How to follow the implementation
There are tags for each chapter of the book. E.g. at the tag `chapter-11-the-walking-skeleton` you will find the
code as present at the end of the chapter.

Commit messages include the expected test status for the commit, e.g. `[RED]` at the start indicates a failing stage.
